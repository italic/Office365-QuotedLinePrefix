  "body": "## What is quote-line prefix?\r\n\r\nInternet-style quoting consists of putting a > character in front of the original message when you reply (or forward) it. Then you reply below the quoted text. Recipients can easily distinguish the original message from your comments.\r\n\r\nLearn more [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Quoted_line_prefix):\r\n\r\n> When Usenet and e-mail users respond to a message, they often want to include some context for the discussion. This is often accomplished by quoting a portion of the original message using Usenet conventions. In essence the convention is to communicate in plain text format (not HTML) and quote with \">\" at the beginning of each line, \">>\" for a quote of quote, and so on. Most email clients can perform Usenet quoting automatically.)\r\n\r\n## Why this plugin?\r\n\r\nQuote-line prefix is currently not available inside Outlook Web App for Exchange 365.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Original message\r\n\r\n1. https://files.not.live/original-message.png\r\n\r\n### Quoted line \"Reply to\" default view\r\n\r\n2. https://files.not.live/reply.png\r\n\r\n### Conversation sample\r\n\r\n3. https://files.not.live/conversation.png\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\n- colored conversation levels\r\n- better conformation with [RFC1849](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1849.html)\r\n- automatic word-wrapping of the quoted text lines at 72 characters\r\n- ability to replace the > character\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nFor any question please raise an issue on GitHub or ask @italic_fr on Twitter.",
