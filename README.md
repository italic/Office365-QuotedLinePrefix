# Office365-QuotedLinePrefix
An Office 365 plugin that enables quoted-line prefix in Outlook Web App

## What is quote-line prefix?

Internet-style quoting consists of putting a > character in front of the original message when you reply (or forward) it. Then you reply below the quoted text. Recipients can easily distinguish the original message from your comments.

> When Usenet and e-mail users respond to a message, they often want to include some context for the discussion. This is often accomplished by quoting a portion of the original message using Usenet conventions. In essence the convention is to communicate in plain text format (not HTML) and quote with ">" at the beginning of each line, ">>" for a quote of quote, and so on. Most email clients can perform Usenet quoting automatically.)

## Why this plugin?

Quote-line prefix is currently not available inside Outlook Web App for Exchange 365.
